# Feature coverage: what Forge3D can do, and what Studio brings of it

The engine's own inventory is `docs/guides/feature_map.md` (its workflows, not
its module layout). This page is the other half: for each workflow, what the
Studio exposes, what it cannot reach, and why. It is the answer to "are all
Forge3D's features brought to Studio?" — the honest answer is *no, and here is
exactly which ones and what each one costs*.

Two rules govern the table:

* **A control must change pixels.** A parameter measured at 0 changed samples
  on Studio's render path is not exposed; the audit gate
  (`tests/test_studio_surface_audit.py`) keeps the model free of them.
* **A shell must not re-implement an engine mechanism.** Where the engine has
  a path, Studio uses it (supersampling is `render_scale`, the class palette is
  `thematic.apply_palette`, the camera is `camera_render_view`, the plate's
  legend is `forge3d.legend.Legend`).

## 1. The stage

| Phase | What it was | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0–2 | Shell, project model, Solid viewport | done |
| 3 | Workspace switching | dropped on purpose (rendering lives in the viewport) |
| 4–7 | Rendered mode, materials, timeline, hardening | done |
| 8–9 | Engine facts in the probe, sun from date/place | done |
| 10 | AOV + OIDN final stills | done |
| 11 | Colormaps, sun visibility, vertical scale, despeckle | done |
| 12 | Map plate, map furniture, categorical legend | done |
| 13 | The map look (one button), the release audit as a CI gate | done |
| 14 | **The engine's cartographic tier** (vectors, labels, furniture) | shipped: lines and labels (furniture next) |
| 15 | Convergence on `MapScene` as the scene model | design increment, trigger-gated |

Studio exposes **79 controls** — the app's 50 numeric fields, 3 range sliders,
17 toggles, 5 choice fields and 4 text fields (the earlier count, 68,
predated the vector layer's colour, width and label controls) — over 28
render settings, the scene model (terrain, mesh, camera, light), the timeline,
the map plate and the map's layer stack. The engine's
public Python surface is **382 names** (the label compositor joined it); the
table below is the honest breakdown of what a *terrain and cartography studio*
needs from those.

## 2. The inventory

| Engine workflow (from its feature map) | Studio | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Interactive terrain viewing | **own path** | Studio's viewport is three.js; the still is the engine's offscreen terrain pass |
| Terrain inputs (`mini_dem`, `fetch_dem`, datasets, COG) | partial | local GeoTIFF only; no dataset fetching, no COG streaming |
| Raster overlays (`ViewerHandle.load_overlay`) | **full** | the drape, in the Material preview and in Rendered, at the source's resolution |
| Thematic rasters (categorical/bivariate styles) | partial | the class palette and the elevation ramp; no bivariate styles, no `MapScene` styles |
| Vector overlays and labels | **lines and labels** | the engine's projection + OIT rasterizer for the lines; the engine's label plan + text compositor for the labels; on the quality surface both are drawn by the engine in the terrain's own pass, with the ground's depth; furniture is the rest of the tier |
| The map as a layer stack | **full** | the studio's own ordered stack (relief, ramp, imagery, vector, labels, plate), drawn back to front by the render service |
| The gallery's recipes as starter scenes | **full** | the Swiss land-cover, the Luxembourg rail network and the Mount Fuji labels, with their layers, camera and sun |
| Map furniture (title, caption, north arrow, scale bar, legend) | **full** | the plate layer's own switches, drawn by the studio's page compositor |
| Picking and selection | partial | the Solid view picks objects; the engine's terrain picking is not used |
| Point clouds | none | a different product tier |
| Camera automation (`animation`, `camera_rigs`) | partial | the timeline's camera path and FOV reach the render; **object channels do not** |
| Terrain quality controls (`terrain_params`, `presets`) | partial | 28 settings are wired; the engine's presets are not exposed |
| Water surfaces and optics | **full** | the mask, the physical surface, the roughness |
| Screen-space effects (SSAO, SSGI, SSR, clouds) | **full** | the engine's quality surface; the still renders on it (the AOV finals cannot) |
| Native/offscreen rendering | **full** | `TerrainRenderer.render_terrain_pbr_pom` |
| Reference-scene matching (`recover_scene`) | none | a research tool |
| Typed map scenes (`MapScene`, `LabelLayer`, buildings, 3D Tiles) | **none** | the phase-14/15 target |
| Geographic preparation (`PreparationRecipe`) | none | the engine prepares; Studio opens what is prepared |
| Ordered map composition (`MapScene.render_passes`) | none | the plate is a Studio-side composite |
| Geometry, mesh, vector, SDF, path tracing | none | tier-2 (different products) |
| Device and memory diagnostics | **full** | the probe and the status bar |
| Map plates and furniture (`MapPlate`, `Legend`, `ScaleBar`, `NorthArrow`) | **own plate** | `MapPlate` is Pro-gated, so Studio composes its own page from the engine's `Legend` |
| Linked publications, vector export, buildings, Mapbox styles, bundles | none | Pro or tier-2 |

## 3. The tools that are not connected

Each of these is a place where the Studio shows something the engine never
sees. They are the reason the app feels loose.

1. **Object animation does not reach the render.** The timeline can key any
   object's nine transform channels, but only the camera path and the camera's
   field of view are sent to the engine; a keyed mesh never appears in the
   exported frames (meshes do not reach Rendered yet — the capability table
   says so). *Fix:* either ship meshes in Rendered (phase 15), or mark
   non-camera channels as preview-only in the timeline.
2. **The Material preview is never shadowed.** The viewport's sun has a full
   shadow rig configured and then `castShadow = false`, so the preview shows a
   flat-lit map while the still carries the ray-marched hillshade the map look
   turns on. *Fix:* one line plus an acne check, or an honest note in the panel.
3. **The preview and the still are two renderers.** They agree on the lighting
   rig, the exposure and the tone-map by construction, but the engine's terrain
   shading (triplanar layers, AO, sun visibility, shadows) only exists in the
   still. The ramp and the drape *are* in both (that is why Phase 8 put the
   ramp in the preview).
4. **The Studio has its own scene model and camera mapping.** The camera's
   Solid-to-renderer mapping is implemented twice — `viewMath.computeRenderView`
   in TypeScript and `workspace::compute_render_view` in Rust — and pinned to
   one shared golden vector so the two cannot drift. Duplication, but a
   *checked* one.
5. **The Studio README links to an untracked file.** `studio-tauri/README.md`
   points at `../FORGE3D_STUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, which was not in the
   repository: the plan the product is built from was invisible to anyone who
   cloned it. Now tracked.

## 4. Cleanup

Done in this pass:

* the dead ambient-occlusion control (0 changed samples, 2 s per frame) —
  deleted, not documented;
* the zScale and frame-size ranges the engine refuses — the model now
  rejects them like the engine does;
* the duplicated camera mapping — kept, but pinned by a golden vector instead
  of by convention;
* the plan file the README links to — tracked.

Still open, in order of value:

* the **Material preview's shadows** (a flat preview against a shadowed still);
* the **timeline's preview-only channels** (a control that cannot reach the
  output);
* the engine's **presets** and **dataset fetching** (Studio opens what is
  prepared; the engine can fetch it);
* the studio's own **plate compositor** versus the engine's Pro `MapPlate` —
  documented, and the reason the plate is not in the Pro tier.

## 5. The phases

**Phase 15 — the map is a layer stack.** The map's decisions used to live in
three places (the terrain object's draped raster and vector layer, the render
settings' colormap and plate). They are one ordered stack now
(`Project::cartography`): each layer has a kind, a name, an eye and its own
style, and the Studio has a **Cartography workspace** — a Photoshop-like layer
panel on the left, the map in the middle, the selected layer's properties on
the right. The shell's own model, but the shape matches MapScene's recipe
layers, so the convergence below is a mapping rather than a rewrite.

**Phase 14 — the engine's cartographic tier** — **shipped: lines and labels**
(`docs/goal-phase-14-cartographic-tier.md`): the rail network draws on the
Luxembourg DEM and on the plate through the engine's own projection and OIT
rasterizer, and the place names draw through the engine's label plan and its
text compositor (`forge3d.composite_label_layers`, made public for callers
that own their pixels). Still open in the tier: furniture, polygons, a legend
for the vector attributes, and labels occluded by the terrain's ridges.

**Converge on `MapScene`.** The engine's typed map scene carries labels,
buildings, 3D Tiles, furniture, graticules and bundles; Studio has its own
model and its own service. The map's layer stack (above) is shaped like
MapScene's recipe layers, so the convergence is now a mapping: the stack's
layers become the recipe's layers, and the engine's own compositors draw
them. *Trigger:* the labels already adopted the engine's label plan and text
compositor rather than a second implementation — the rest of the tier can
follow the same road.

**Phase 16 — the preview matches the still.** The preview's shadows, the
hillshade and the plate's crop in the viewport, so authoring shows the output.

**Phase 17 — the engine's inputs.** Dataset fetching, the engine's presets,
COG streaming: Studio opens what the engine can fetch.

**Not planned:** path tracing, splats, inverse rendering, point clouds,
volumetrics, the globe. Different product tiers, and the roadmap's §8 already
says so.

//! Workspace handoff: what a project can carry into the Forge3D workspace, and
//! what it cannot.
//!
//! This module is pure. It reads the canonical project and produces a
//! payload the Forge3D viewer receives, so the rules
//! are testable without Python, a GPU, or a display.
//!
//! The rules are grounded in the viewer's actual IPC surface
//! (`python/forge3d/viewer.py`): it loads one glTF/OBJ/terrain, moves a camera
//! (`cam_lookat`, `set_fov`), and drives a sun (`lit_sun`). It has no command
//! for Studio primitives, point lights, or per-object materials.

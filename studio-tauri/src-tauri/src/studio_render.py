"""Forge3D Studio's embedded renderer.

A persistent offscreen renderer driven by the Studio shell over stdin/stdout.
No viewer window: this is what "Rendered" mode in the Studio viewport uses, and
what a still render will use.

The renderer, session, and environment map are built once: shader compilation and

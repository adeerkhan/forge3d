/**
 * Offline render queue — the pure half.
 *
 * The viewport scheduler is "newest wins" (a preview is disposable). Offline
 * work is the opposite: a still or a frame sequence is a job that must run to
 * completion, in order, with visible progress and a cancel that stops between
 * frames. This module owns the job state machine; `session.tsx` owns the IPC.
 *
 * Keeping the rules here means the queue can be tested without a shell: order,
 * the single-running invariant, progress, and what "cancel" means for a job
 * that is already inside a frame.

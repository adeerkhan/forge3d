"""The release audit, as a test.

The goal prompt asks for four checks before every release. Two of them are
mechanical and belong in CI rather than in a reviewer's memory:

* **every `RenderSettings` field reaches the payload** — a field nobody reads
  is dead configuration, and the rule is to delete it, not to document it;
* **the payload and the service agree in both directions** — a key the shell
  sends that the service ignores is a control that does nothing, and a key the
  service reads that the shell never sends is a control that cannot work;
* **the project model carries no parameter the engine ignores** — the
  registry below is what was *measured* at 0 changed samples on the path
  Studio renders through (the roadmap has the numbers).

The ranges audit (every UI control inside the engine's range) and the
"no second implementation" audit stay manual: they compare against the
engine's own contracts, which a text scan cannot see.
